I took a csv with the information and processed it using d3s built in csv parser. From their I worked on pivoting off of state
name and indicator. An indicator is essentially a more specific cause of death that you want to look at, mainly the type of drug
or drug class.

I created an average function that would find the average number of deaths from all of the states given a certain indicator.
I made this line red to distiguish from the rest as see in the screen shot below

I made it where you could select from either the map or the checkboxes. This would make the corresponding state red.
I updated whichever profile waas not the one being used when the other one was (i.e. made the check appear if you selected
the state or made the state colored when you selected the checkbox).

You can also see the state name and the state turn orange when you hover over the
corresponding line.

You can choose the range of dates using the drop down menu as shown:

And you can choose the indicator based on the drop down under the checkboxes

Lastly some interesting points:
You can see a rise in deaths about the end of 2016, my guess is this is due to the opiod epidemic:
